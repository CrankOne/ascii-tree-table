It is just a draft!

# Sortable ASCII Treetable Library

This is an effort to create a [treetable](http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-treetable/)
view to browse the complex tree-like data structures within the pure
terminal.

I'm not expecting this thing to become ready soon. In fact, it is just a
week-end project, a promising gist.

See notes.txt to meet the basic gist and random thoughts.
